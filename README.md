# FizzBuzz

## What is this repository for?

Fizzbuzz is a function that accepts an interger, x,  as an argument and return an output for x according to the following rules:
* If x is a positive integer (i.e., greater than 0) and:
    * divisible by 3, return the string 'Fizz'
    * divisible by 5, return the string 'Buzz'
    * divisible by both 3 and 5, return the string 'FizzBuzz'

If x doesn't satisfy any of the above conditions, simply return x.

## Requirements

* Python 3.5.x

## How to Use
